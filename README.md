# FreeMind XSLT exporter(s)

## In a nutshell

These XSLT stylesheets are for exporting content from the XML format of FreeMind mindmapping tool to different output formats.

* *mm2markdown*: Export to Markdown format which I then use with PanDoc to for creating slides based on Reveal.js
  * Known bugs: exporting numbered lists in notes of a node does not work
